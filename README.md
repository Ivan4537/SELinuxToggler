# SELinuxModeChanger-Reboot
A Reboot of the original SELinuxModeChanger from MrBIMC. This is a simple android app that allows the user to manually change a device's default SELinux mode from its Enforcement state to a Permissive state and back. This state can also be set to change upon each boot. Knowing that the original app from MrBIMC had been banned by Google, i plan to continue this to be an opensourced project. Enjoy!
