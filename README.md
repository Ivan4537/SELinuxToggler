# SELinuxToggler

This is the SelinuxToggler (A Reboot off the depreciated "SELinuxModeChanger" from MrBIMC).

This is a simple android app that allows the user to manually change a device's default SELinux Mode from its Enforcement state to a Permissive state and back. This state can also be set to change upon each boot. 

Though, the original SELinuxModeChanger is an opensourced project, this Github repository for the SELinuxToggler will eventually be updated as opensourced as well.

Please Enjoy!
