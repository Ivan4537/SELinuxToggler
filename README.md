# SELinuxToggler

The SelinuxToggler is a Reboot off the [depreciated] SELinuxModeChanger by MrBIMC (Located Here: https://github.com/mrbimc/SELinuxModeChanger).

This is a simple android app that allows the user to manually change a device's default SELinux Mode from its Enforcement state to a Permissive state and back. This state can also be set to change upon each boot. 

Though, the original SELinuxModeChanger is an opensourced project, this Github repository for the SELinuxToggler will eventually be updated as opensourced as well.

Please Enjoy!
